# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page AJAX based Twitter clone that uses JQuery, HTML5 and CSS. 

This repository contains all the files for the project. This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery and AJAX for front-end and Node, Express and MongoDB for back-end. Tweeter includes, a fixed header, animated buttons and tweet containers, a functional character limit counter, as well as both desktop and tablet/smartphone modes.
